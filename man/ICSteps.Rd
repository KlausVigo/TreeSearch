\usage{
ICSteps(
  char,
  ambiguousToken = "?",
  expectedMinima = 25L,
  maxIter = 10000L,
  warn = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{char}{The character in question.}

\item{ambiguousToken}{Which token, if any, corresponds to the ambiguous token
(?) (not yet fully implemented).}

\item{expectedMinima}{sample enough trees that the rarest step counts is
expected to be seen at least this many times.}

\item{maxIter}{Maximum iterations to conduct.}

\item{warn}{Boolean (\code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE}): display warnings when concavity
functions are generated by approximation.}
}
\description{
\code{ICSteps()} estimates the phylogenetic information content of a character
\code{char} when \emph{e} extra steps are present, for all possible values of \emph{e}.
}
\details{
Calculates the number of trees consistent with the character having
\emph{e} extra steps, where \emph{e} ranges from its minimum possible value
(i.e. number of different tokens minus one) to its maximum.
The number of trees with no extra steps can be calculated exactly; the
number of trees with more additional steps must be approximated.
The function samples \code{maxIter} trees, or enough trees that the trees with
the minimum number of steps will be recovered at least \code{expectedMinima}
times, in order to obtain precise results.
}
\examples{
character <- rep(c(0:3, '?'), c(8, 5, 1, 1, 2))
suppressWarnings(ICSteps(character))

# MS Temp Example testing
char <- character
ambiguousToken = '?'
expectedMinima = 25
maxIter = 100
warn = TRUE
