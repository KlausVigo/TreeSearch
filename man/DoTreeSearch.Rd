\usage{
DoTreeSearch(tree, data, TreeScorer = FitchScore, Rearrange = NNI,
  maxIter = 100, maxHits = 20, forestSize = 1, cluster = NULL,
  track = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A tree of class \code{\link{phylo}}, with tip labels in the order generated by 
\code{\link{RenumberTips}}, i.e. corresponding corresponding the sequence of taxa 
in the corresponding Morphy object.}

\item{data}{dataset in the format expected by TreeScorer}

\item{TreeScorer}{function to generate optimality score; defaults to \code{\link{FitchScore}}}

\item{Rearrange}{function to be used for tree rearrangements: probably \link{\code{NNI}},
\link{\code{SPR}} or \link{\code{TBR}}}

\item{maxIter}{Maximum iterations}

\item{maxHits}{stop search after finding optimal score \code{maxHits} times}

\item{forestSize}{number of trees to store in memory}

\item{track}{Verbosity of reporting}
}
\value{
a tree of class \code{phylo} with attributes "hits" (number of times hit) and "pscore"
        (score given by TreeScorer)
}
\description{
Performs a tree search
}
\details{
Does the hard work of searching for a most parsimonious tree.
End-users are expected to access this function through its wrapper, TreeSearch
It is also called directly by Ratchet and Sectorial functions
