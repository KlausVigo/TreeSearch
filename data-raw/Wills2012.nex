BEGIN NOTES
  TEXT CHARACTER=27 TEXT="Budd (2003) has drawn comparison between the patterns of cuticular ornament in association with the trunk annulae in lobopods and palacoscolecids. However, although palaeoscolecids exhibit an alternating pattern of cuticular ornament (Conway Morris 1997) and although this varies from one body region to another, adjacent annulae are identical; they exhibit homomous annulation. This contrasts with the condition in lobopods where adjacent annulae vary both in terms of their axial length and their cuticular ornamentation.";
  TEXT CHARACTER=3 TEXT="Schmidt-Rhaesa (1998) has demonstrated that, in comparison to the scalids of Scalidophora (Kinorhyncha +Loricifera+Priapulida), the scalids of nematoids (Nematoda+Nematomorpha) are composed exclusively of cuticle. The collapse and folding of the scalids in Markuelia indicates that they are hollow structures and, thus, not wholly composed of cuticle.";
  TEXT CHARACTER=4 TEXT="The mouth cone is the eversible (though not necessarily inversible) upstanding anterior limit of the pharynx.";
  TEXT CHARACTER=9 TEXT="In all extant priapulids there are eight elements in the most proximal circlet of the introvert, their number and position corresponding to innervation derived from the circumpharyngeal brain. ";
  TEXT CHARACTER=45 TEXT=" Harvey et al. (2010) coded a caudal appendage as present in Kerygmachela. However, other characters contingent on the presence of a caudal appendage are coded as inapplicable for Kerygmachela by these authors (as for taxa lacking a caudal appendage). We therefore code an appendage as absent in Kerygmachela. ";
  TEXT CHARACTER=67 TEXT="Protonephridia are considered an apomorphy of the Bilateria (Ax, 1996) and are present in gastrotrichs, kinorhynchs, loriciferans and extant priapulids, but absent, presumably secondarily, from onychophorans, nematodes and nematomorphs. Lemburg (1999) recognized state 2 as a synapomorphy of lorciferans and extant priapulids.";
