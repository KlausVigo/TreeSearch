abstract = {Leaf-labelled trees are widely used to describe evolutionary relationships, particularly in biology. In this setting, extant species label the leaves of the tree, while the internal vertices correspond to ancestral species. Various techniques exist for reconstructing these evolutionary trees from data, and an important problem is to determine how ?far apart? two such reconstructed trees are from each other, or indeed from the true historical tree. To investigate this question requires tree metrics, and these can be induced by operations that rearrange trees locally. Here we investigate three such operations: nearest neighbour interchange (NNI), subtree prune and regraft (SPR), and tree bisection and reconnection (TBR). The SPR operation is of particular interest as it can be used to model biological processes such as horizontal gene transfer and recombination. We count the number of unrooted binary trees one SPR from any given unrooted binary tree, as well as providing new upper and lower bounds for the diameter of the adjacency graph of trees under SPR and TBR.We also show that the problem of computing the minimum number of TBR operations required to transform one tree to another can be reduced to a problem whose size is a function just of the distance between the trees (and not of the size of the two trees), and thereby establish that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable.},

@article{Goloboff1997,
abstract = {A method to assess the cost of character state transformations based on their congruence is proposed. Measuring the distortion of different transformations with a convex increasing function of the number of transformations, and choosing those reconstructions which minimize the distortion for all transformations, may provide a better optimality criterion than the linear functions implemented in currently used methods for optimization. If trees are optimized using such a measure, transformation costs are dynamically determined during reconstructions; this leads to selecting trees implying that the possible state transformations are as reliable as possible. The present method is not iterative (thus avoiding the concern of different final results for different starting points), and it has an explicit optimality criterion. It has a high computational cost; algorithms to lessen the computations required for optimizations and searches are described.},
