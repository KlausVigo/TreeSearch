# TreeSearch
This package exists to allow parsiomony-style tree searches in R.

It extends the basic functionality available in phangorn, with a view to making tree search faster and more efficient.
Heuristic searches such as the Parsimony Ratchet are implemented.

The library requires a working version of phangorn > 2.2.1, which is not yet available through CRAN:

```
devtools::install_github('KlausVigo/phangorn', ref='7192bfb4403c35c16a7b735160525d272736b061') # 30 oct 2017
```
