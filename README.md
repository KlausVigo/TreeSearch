# TreeSearch
This package exists to allow parsiomony-style tree searches in R.

It extends the basic functionality available in phangorn, with a view to making tree search faster and more efficient.
Heuristic searches such as the Parsimony Ratchet are implemented.

The library is currently in development and is not ready for use.
