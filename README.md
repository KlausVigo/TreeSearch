# TreeSearch
This package exists to allow parsiomony-style tree searches in R.

It extends the basic functionality available in phangorn, with a view to making tree search faster and more efficient, 
and allowing user-defined optimality criteria to be employed.

Heuristic searches such as the Parsimony Ratchet are implemented (function: `Ratchet`).

The key function is `TreeSearch`, which takes a tree and a dataset; functions can be specified to 'load' the 
data (perhaps sending it to C?) and to score a tree (the Fitch algorithm is used by default).
